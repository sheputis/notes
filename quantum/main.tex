\section{Motivation}

\begin{figure}[h]

           opposite directions to planet A and B respectively}
\end{figure}

Look I added an emoji \emoji{😄}. Anyways, let's say we have an entangled pair of particles,
for example an electron and a positron whose spins are entangled. Alice receives the electron
on planet A and Bob receives the positron on planet B. If either 'observe' the state of the spin
of their particle, the other particle will immediately also collapse into some state as prescribed
by the entangled quantum state. For example, if the overall state was

\[
\ket{\psi} = a\ket{01} + b\ket{10}
\]

(Let $0$ represent the spin down state and $1$ the up state)

we see that there are only two possible states:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Either A is in spin down and B is in spin up with probability $\abs{a}^2$
  \item Or A is in spin up and B is in spin down with probability $\abs{b}^2$
\end{itemize}

All well and good so far, but here is a catch. Bob does not know it, but Alice has a crush
on him. Alice is finally ready to invite Bob on a date. There is only one problem, apart
from the fact that they live on different planets: Clara also likes Bob, and she is currently
in the same city as Bob. She is also about to drive to Bob to proclaim her admiration for his
quantum knowledge. Alice knows this for some reason and is devastated. Planet A is 10 lightyears
away. If she will send a Whatsapp message to Bob now, by the time Bob reads that Alice thinks
his quantum logic is hot, it will be 10 years lated and he will already have 5 kids with Clara.

Its late at night and Matteo has made sure the fire is heating the cabin really good. He is expecting
Alice to come through the door any minute now. He had finally managed to ask her out. And he is
not wasting any time: if he did not take this seriously he would take her to the movies or some simple
thing like that. But with Alice he wants to hit the home run right away. And a cabin trip alla Matteo
is a nuclear weapon in the romantic world. An unrestistable smell of spagetthi carbonara has taken over
the cabin. Matteo' special secret is to not use the timer for the spagetthi. He has to feeeel the spagetthi
and only strike it out of the water when he feels deep in his soul that the time is high, just like he
will do with Alice later that night. While rehearsing his romantic lines in front of an old mirror, he
could not tell if the twinkles in his eyes actually were a reflection of the hundred candles he lit up
everywhere or if he is just that excited.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{Golly gee can't wait!}
\end{figure}

Matteo was just about to finish pointing his index fingers towards the mirror anyways as the door
opened with a sudden crackle followed by a gust of cold winter air finding its way into the room.
Alice has finally arrived, but to Matteo's horror, she was crying! The carbonara was already long
cold and the last more stubborn candles were holding on for dear life in an attempt to prolong the night.
So was Matteo's mood as he was listening to Alice going on and on about Bob and sobbing. Only if she
could somehow send Bob a message before Clara gets to him and charms him.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/matteo_disappointed.png}
  \caption{Oh Bob, my admiration for you is faster than light}
\end{figure}

She is frantically telling Matteo that she knows quite a bit of quantum physics because her full time
job is appearing in quantum thought experiments. She tells him she has recently received an electron from
a planet far far away (actually, a whole bunch of them that is in Bob's possession. All she needs to do is
to observe its spin state and bang: the positron instantly assumes the opposite state. That is instant!
Surely she can somehow make use of this fact to send a message to Bob before its too late! That is not
what Matteo wanted to hear tonight, the situation seems hopeless... the night is ruined. Or is it? Matteo
has one last trick up his sleeve. As a professor in Category Theory, he is going to use his mathematical
powers to prove to Alice that even though the collapse on the quantum state is instant, she will not be
able to send information to Bob faster than the speed of light, and that she is better off forgetting Bob
and enjoing the carbonara with him tonight.
